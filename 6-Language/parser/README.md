# py-parser
An AI to parse sentences and extract noun phrases.

This app was implemented with context-free grammar formalism to parse English sentences to determine their structure.

- PP: preposition phrase
- AP: adjective phrase
- Adj: adjectives
- Adv: adverbs
- Conj: conjunctions
- Det: determiners
- N: nouns

The parser.py accepts a text file as input or the user can write the sentence<br>
Run: python parser.py [text.txt]
