# py-heredity
An AI to assess the likelihood that a person will have a particular genetic trait.

This app was implemented with joint probability to calculate probability of people having a certain number of genes and traits, based on GJB2 gene (hearing impairment in newborns) and is conditional on what genes their parents have.<br>
This application can be expanded to other diseases and genetic patterns.

Run: python heredity.py data/family0.csv
